/-- This is the equivalent of Haskell QuickCheck's `Arbitrary` typeclass
    reprensenting types for which there exists a random generator suitable
    for property-based testing.
    (In QuickChick, this typeclass is called `Gen`, but `Gen` is already
    a reserved keyword in Plausible, so we call this typeclass `Arbitrary`
    following the Haskell QC convention). -/

  arbitrary : Gen α

/-- A typeclass for sized generation.
    Equivalent to QuickChick's `arbitrarySized` typeclass -/
class ArbitrarySized (α : Type) where
  arbitrarySized : Nat → Gen α

/-- Every `ArbitrarySized` instance gives rise to an `Arbitrary` instance -/

  arbitrary := GeneratorCombinators.sized ArbitrarySized.arbitrarySized

/-- If we have `Repr`, `ArbitrarySized` & `Shrinkable` instances for a type,
    then that type gets a `SampleableExt` instance
    - Note: Plausible's `SampleableExt` is analogous to QuickChick's `Arbitrary` typeclass
      (which combines QuickChick's `Gen` and `Shrink` typeclass)-/
instance [Repr α] [Shrinkable α] [ArbitrarySized α] : SampleableExt α :=
  SampleableExt.mkSelfContained (GeneratorCombinators.sized ArbitrarySized.arbitrarySized)

/-- Any type which implements Plausible's `SampleableExt` can be given an instance of
    our `Arbitrary` typeclass -/
